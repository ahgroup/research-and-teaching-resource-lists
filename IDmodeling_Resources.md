#Resources to do Infectious Disease Modeling (in R)

*List maintained by Andreas Handel (ahandel@uga.edu). Last updated 9/2/2016.*

*If you know of other good resources, please let me know.*


##Conceptual/General Resources

* The folks behind the [Epidemics MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics) produced [a webpage with interesting ID related resources](http://epidemics.psu.edu/)

* [A number of teaching resources for various aspects of infectious disease dynamics](https://nrich.maths.org/epidemic)

##Books
Sorted in order of difficulty (according to my opinion)

* [An introduction to infectious disease modeling by Emilia Vynnycky and Richard White](http://www.anintroductiontoinfectiousdiseasemodelling.com/)

* [Modeling Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals by Matt J. Keeling & Pejman Rohani](http://www.modelinginfectiousdiseases.org/)


##Computational Resources

[The R Epidemics Consortium](https://reconhub.github.io/) maintains several R packages related to infectious disease modeling.

[The pomp R package to fit stochastic dynamic models (and more) to time-series data.](http://kingaa.github.io/pomp/)
