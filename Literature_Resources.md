###Quickly learning 'everything' about a new topic:

- Find an influential review paper on the topic. For instance search in Web of Science, turn on the "Reviews" filter, then sort by citations. Look at the highly cited papers. Read some of those papers.

- Once you found the most relevant review paper for your topic, check who cites the paper (can be done in e.g. Web of Science). Check the titles/abstracts, take a closer look at relevant papers.


###Quickly figuring out if your question/idea is new:

- If you don't know much about the topic, follow the instructions above.

- Find a few of the most influential/cited papers on the specific question you are interested in. Check every paper that cites those studies. This should provide a fairly complete overview of 'everything' that's been done on that topic. Assess if your idea is new or has been done before.


###Learning more about a specific topic:

- As you learn about a research area/topic, figure out who the main important people are. Search for their work. Read some/all of their papers.



###Keeping up with the literature:

There are several ways one can try to stay up-to-date with the literature. Here are some possible strategies. 

- Follow specific journals, e.g. by subscribing to table of content emails.

- Follow specific topics, e.g. by setting alerts in places like ScienceDirect (only Elsevier journals), Google alerts, PubMed

- Follow specific individuals, e.g. by setting alerts in PubMed, Google Scholars, ResearchGate

A combination of these strategies might be best.

- Make sure to spend time each week to read/skim a few papers.


###Managing references:

- Use a reference manager!

- Good free ones (in my opinion) are Bibtex/Jabref, Zotero, Mendeley.

- Non-free ones are Endnote, Papers, RefWorks

- [Wikipedia has a comparison list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software)

- Check the features of different reference managers, figure out what works best for your workflow. 

- Play around with a few managers, then pick one.

- Don't forget to include considerations of collaborative work into your decision.
