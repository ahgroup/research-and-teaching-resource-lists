This list is a collection of specific commands to do specific text/string manipulations in R.



## Insert a blank between 2 bits of text.

This uses regex capturing groups.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gsub("(#)(\\w)","\\1 \\2", text) # first symbol is a #, second is a word character. an empty space is inserted.  
gsub("(#)([A-Z])","\\1 \\2", text) # first symbol is a #, second is an upper case letter. an empty space is inserted.
```
