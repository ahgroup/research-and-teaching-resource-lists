#R plotting commands cheat-sheet

This list is a collection of specific commands to do specific (pieces of) plots that I often need. Most of the commands use ggplot2.

*List maintained by Andreas Handel (ahandel@uga.edu). Last updated 12/9/2016.*
*If you know of other good examples, please let me know.*


__Conventions:__ The data is assumed to be a data frame called `dat`, I'm using the pipe-operator notation, the outcome of interest is called `outcome`, variables are `var1`, `var2`, etc. or just refered to as `varname`. ggplot library is assumed to be loaded for most commands.
