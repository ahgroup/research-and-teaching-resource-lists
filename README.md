Several lists/collections of links to resources related to the R programming language, as well as specific topics and R.

The lists are maintained as Markdown files. You can just click on the files (e.g. R_Resources.md) and github will render it looking (somewhat) nice and definitely readable.

These lists are maintained by Andreas Handel. If you got suggestions for updates/improvements or something doesn't work, let me know either the 'github way' or if you are unfamiliar with github, just email me (ahandel@uga.edu).
