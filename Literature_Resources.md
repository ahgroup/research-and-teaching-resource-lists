### Quickly learning a new topic:

- If you know 'nothing', maybe start reading about it on Wikipedia, CDC website, WHO, etc. Often information on those sites provide links to the primary literature.

- Find an influential review paper on the topic. For instance search in Web of Science, turn on the "Reviews" filter, then sort by citations. Look at the highly cited papers. Read some of those papers. The same strategy can likely be done in PubMed, Scopus, etc.

- Once you found the most relevant review paper for your topic, check who cites the paper (can be done in e.g. Web of Science). Check the titles/abstracts, take a closer look at relevant papers.

- [Iris.Ai](https://the.iris.ai/) - an AI search engine that claims to make diving into a new topic easier by grouping papers.

- [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com)

- [Semantic scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) - a search engine similar to Google scholar. Claims to produce more relevant and targeted results.

- [Microsoft academic](https://academic.microsoft.com/) - Search engine similar to Google scholar.

### Quickly figuring out if your question/idea is new and what closely related work exists:

- If you don't know much about the topic, follow the instructions above.

- Find a few of the most influential/cited papers on the specific question you are interested in. Check every paper that cites those studies. This should provide a fairly complete overview of most everything that's been done on that topic. Assess if your idea is new or has been done before.


### Learning more about a specific topic:

- As you learn about a research area/topic, figure out who the main important people are. Search for their work. Read some/all of their papers.



### Keeping up with the literature:

There are several ways one can try to stay up-to-date with the literature. Here are some possible strategies. 

- Follow specific journals, e.g. by subscribing to table of content emails.

- Follow specific topics, e.g. by setting alerts in places like ScienceDirect (only Elsevier journals), Google alerts, PubMed

- Follow specific individuals, e.g. by setting alerts in PubMed, Google Scholars, ResearchGate

A combination of these strategies might be best.

- Make sure to spend time each week to read/skim a few papers.


### Managing references:

- Use a reference manager!

- Good free ones (in my opinion) are Bibtex/Jabref, Zotero, Mendeley.

- Non-free ones are Endnote, Papers, RefWorks

- [Wikipedia has a comparison list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software)

- Check the features of different reference managers, figure out what works best for your workflow and setting. 

- Play around with a few managers, then pick one.

- Don't forget to include considerations of collaborative work into your decision.
