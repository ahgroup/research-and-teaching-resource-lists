## R books and tutorials


* ["R packages" by Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/). This (free online) book alone is enough to get a package done. Should definitely be the first (and maybe even only) source to read/use.
* [How to quickly write an R package](http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/)
* [A series of online videos talking about package development](https://youtu.be/79s3z0gIuFU)

## Useful packages
* `devtools`, `roxygen2`, etc. - almost required for development. See Hadley's book.
* `available` - tests if a specific name is still available
*
