*Several lists/collections of links to resources related to research and teaching and career.*

These lists are maintained by Andreas Handel. If you have suggestions for updates/improvements or something doesn't work, let me know (using github issues or pull requests).  

The majority of content in those lists are collections of links to other sources. Some contain a few of my own thoughts on specific topics. The content is heavily biased by my own work. For research topics, the focus is in statistics/data analysis, infectious disease modeling and the R programming language. The other lists focus on research/academic careers and topics related to it.

The lists are written as Markdown files. You can just click on the .md files and github will render it looking (somewhat) nice and definitely readable.

Currently available lists are (in alphabetical order):

- *Career_Resources.md:* Information on (academic/research) career related resources. 

- *Communication_Resources.md:* Information on how to communicate (scientific) information to various audiences.

- *Dataanalysis_Resources.md:* Information to help with data analysis and statistics related task, with a focus on R.
