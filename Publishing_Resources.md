### Picking a journal

- *Make sure it's not one of the fake/predatory journals.* Check that the journal/publishier is not on [Beall's list](https://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/). If in doubt, ask senior colleagues their opinion about a specific journal.

- *Aim high, but not too high.* If you never get rejected, maybe you are not aiming high enough (and loosing prestige from publishing in 'fancy' journals). If it always takes you until journal number 5 or so to get published, maybe you are aiming too high (and wasting time/resources). 

- *Consider factors beside prestige.* Sometimes you want/need something published quickly. If you like the Open Access philosophy (and the potentially higher visibility of your work) consider publishing in those journals.

- *Non-for profits first.* That's my personal opinion, but if I can choose between essentially equally good for-profit (e.g. Elsevier, Wiley, Springer, etc.) or non-for profit (e.g. PLoS, society journals) journals, I prefer the non-profits. I don't see why some company should make money off my work (I'm already not charging for publishing and editing my work)!
