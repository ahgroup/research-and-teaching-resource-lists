###General Sources


* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/): Probably the first book you should read if you plan on doing any serious data analysis in R. Heavily focuses on the initial steps of an analysis, including exploratory analysis/visualization. The book is freely available online.



###Visualization

* [R Graph Gallery](http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/): Has lots of examples of graphs and plots in R, including the underlying code that produced the graph. Great place to find a graph similar to one you'd like to make, take the code and adjust it.
