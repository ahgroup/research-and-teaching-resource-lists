##General Sources

### Other lists

* [Awesome data science](https://github.com/bulutyazilim/awesome-datascience) - Someone else's list of resources related to data science.

* [Machine learning book list](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning/blob/master/books.md) - A list of free online books concerning all things machine learning and data analysis.


### Online Courses for Data Analysis

* [All courses in the Data Science Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)

* [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about). 

* [Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/index.html)

* Check out online providers such as Coursera, edX, Udacity, etc. for more such courses


### Data Analysis books

* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - Probably the first book you should read if you plan on doing any serious data analysis in R. The focus is on the initial steps of an analysis (usually the most important ones). Not much coverage of statistical modeling. The book is freely available online.

* [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) - This book is your logical next step. Once you got your data cleaned and done preliminary analyses following the instructions in the previous book, this book will teach different statistical modeling/analysis approaches. Also R based and freely available online.

* [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) - This is the more advanced version by some of the same authors of the previous book. It gets technical, so only suitable once you got the basics figured out.

* [Statistical foundations of machine learning](https://www.otexts.org/book/sfml) 

* [Introduction to Data Science](http://jsresearch.net/index.html)

* [Forecasting: principles and practice](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/)


### Online tutorials

* [A Computerworld tutorial on data wrangling](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243391/4_data_wrangling_tasks_in_R_for_advanced_beginners)


### Useful data-analysis related R packages

* [Caret](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) - a package that allows many different modeling approaches from a single interface

* [Machine Learning in R - mlR](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) - similar concept as Caret but different strengths and weaknesses. I would check out both.


## Specific Topics


### Data cleaning and checking

* Check out the R packages tidyr, plyr, dplyr, validate, vtreat (you can find good documentation for all of them)

* [Data Analysis and Visualization Using R](http://varianceexplained.org/RData/)


### Missing Data/Imputation

* Check out R packages mi, mice, Amelia, missforest, imputation

* Little & Rubin "Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, 2nd Edition"


## Teaching Resources

### Good introductory articles

- [Nice 'explanation' of p-values]([http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/not-even-scientists-can-easily-explain-p-values/)

- [Another stab at p-values]( http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/statisticians-found-one-thing-they-can-agree-on-its-time-to-stop-misusing-p-values/)
