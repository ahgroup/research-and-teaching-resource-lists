Several lists/collections of links to resources related to research and teaching and career.

The focus is in statistics/data analysis, infectious disease modeling and the R programming language.

The career related list focuses on research/academic careers.

The lists are written as Markdown files. You can just click on the .md files and github will render it looking (somewhat) nice and definitely readable.

Currently available lists are:

- R_Resources.md
Contains a list of tutorials, books etc. that help with learning R in general and with learning specific R topics.

- Dataanalysis_Resources.md
A list of tutorials, books, etc. to help with data analysis and statistics related task, with a focus on R.

- IDModeling_Resources.md
A - yet rather empty - list of tutorials, books, software etc. that's useful for ID modeling. To be filled hopefully soon.

- Career_Resources.md
A - yet rather empty - list of links to (academic/research) career related resources. To be filled hopefully soon.

These lists are maintained by Andreas Handel. If you got suggestions for updates/improvements or something doesn't work, let me know (using issues or pull requests).
